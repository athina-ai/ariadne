There have been two small earthquakes in Lancashire since fracking began in the county in March, including the latest on Friday.\nIn an analysis of the April quake published on its website the BGS said: \"Any process that injects pressurised water into rocks at depth will cause the rock to fracture and possibly produce earthquakes.\n\"It is well known that injection of water or other fluids during the oil extraction and geothermal engineering, such as Shale gas, processes can result in earthquake activity.\"\nThe BGS said the April tremor took place 1.2 miles (2km) away from the drilling site but said its monitoring instruments were 50 miles (80km) away.\nSpeaking about the latest quake, Dr Brian Baptie, head of seismology at the BGS, said: \"The earthquake was felt by at least one person in Poulton-Le-Fylde.\n\"Our analysis places the epicentre of the event to within 2km of the Preese Hall site.\n\"Data from two temporary instruments close to the drill site, installed after the magnitude 2.3 earthquake on 1 April, indicate that the event occurred at a depth of approximately 2km (1.2 miles).\n\"The recorded waveforms are very similar to those from the magnitude 2.3 event last month, which suggests that the two events share a similar location and mechanism.\"",

        "document": "In his regular BBC Sport column, football pundit Robbie Savage looks at why Liverpool look a long way off repeating last season's title challenge, how they should line up against Chelsea and the physical and mental battle Steven Gerrard faces to secure a long-term future with the Reds.\nIt is only six months since Steven Gerrard's slip helped the Blues clinch a famous win on Merseyside that derailed Liverpool's title bid.\nBack then, at the end of April, the title was in the Reds' grasp. This weekend, I think we will see again how far away they are from mounting another title challenge.\nThey are miles away from the level required for that, and will have to improve and work hard just to get in the top four.\nIf they manage it, then securing back-to-back seasons in the Champions League should be seen as success for Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers.\nBut not all their fans see it that way. I had some unhappy Reds supporters calling me up on  606 on BBC Radio 5 live last weekend to give their manager stick.\nPart of Liverpool's problem is that they overachieved massively last season, which has raised expectations unrealistically. That is not Rodgers' fault.\nWhere he can be questioned is in the transfer market, especially up front.\nBetween them Luis Suarez and Daniel Sturridge scored 52 of Liverpool's 101 Premier League goals last  season.\nWith Suarez sold and Sturridge playing only three out of 10 league games so far this season because of injury, Rodgers has lost a lot of goals from his line-up.\nBut he has had money to spend and I do not think he has bought the right strikers to fit his system.\nLooking at Rodgers' options up front for Saturday, Mario Balotelli, Rickie Lambert and Fabio Borini are his three available front men, and the bottom line is that they are not good enough.\nIt is not just that they do not look like scoring. There is a big difference in their work-rate compared to what Suarez and Sturridge gave the team.\nThat means Liverpool are not starting games with the same intensity they did last season, or pressing teams high up the pitch to force them into mistakes.\nDoing that in 2013-14 Liverpool scored 59 first-half goals, 13 more than any other team, and scored in the first half of 34 out of 38 league matches - again the most in the top flight.\nIn their first 10 games of this campaign, they have only managed a total of four goals before half-time, in three different matches. Instead of being on the front foot, they are having to chase games.\nThey look pedestrian and that is not just the centre-forward's fault.\nWhen I have watched them, no matter what formation they play, they do not seem to have any runners going past their striker from midfield.\nAgain, last season that used to happen all the time, but I was at St James' Park last weekend to  co-commentate on their defeat by Newcastle, and the only player to run beyond Balotelli in the first half was Gerrard, who did it once.\nAnother problem is set-pieces. Liverpool were lethal from them last year, scoring with more than any other top-flight team.\nMore than a third of their goals in 2013-14 came from corners or free-kicks, at a rate of almost one a game. That has dropped off dramatically.\nSadly for Rodgers, seeing the goals drying up is not his only problem.\nLiverpool's defence was seen as their weakest link last season and, despite trying several different combinations, he did not get it right.\nFrom Mamadou Sakho for \u00a318m in 2013 to Dejan Lovren for \u00a320m this summer, Rodgers has thrown a lot of money at the problem but is still trying to find an answer.\nThey still look all over the place at the back.\nStatistically, they are no worse defensively than last season - but they are also no better.\nLiverpool play and complete as many passes as before, and also keep as much possession. But with them no longer being able to outscore the opposition, it is no surprise their results have been affected.\nWhat Liverpool lack at the back is a leader, and their goalkeeper does not give them much help there.\nSimon Mignolet is clearly an excellent shot-stopper but I don't see him coming off his line enough, or commanding his box.\nRodgers tried three at the back against the Magpies, but I cannot see him doing the same against Chelsea.\nHe was criticised for resting players against Real Madrid on Tuesday but I agreed with him for doing it.\nLiverpool can still qualify for the knockout stages in Europe if they win their last two games in Group B and their weakened team actually did better against Real in Spain than the full-strength side he picked at home.\nNow he has to decide who to play against Chelsea, but whoever he picks, Liverpool will need to show a huge improvement on their recent displays.\nMy team to face Liverpool: Mignolet, Johnson, Skrtel, Toure, Moreno, Can, Gerrard, Sterling, Coutinho, Lallana, Borini.\nFor me, Lovren is the big signing who makes way, with Kolo Toure keeping his place after doing well at the Bernabeu.\nIt is a big call to drop Lovren when Rodgers has spent so much money on him, but he has just not been good enough.\nIt is hard to see Liverpool winning on Saturday because Chelsea are on a different planet\nHe was poor against Newcastle and has been poor all season.\nAlthough he has got the height that Liverpool will need to defend set-pieces against Chelsea, I saw him get bossed around by Bobby Zamora when Liverpool played QPR at Loftus Road. You have to think that Diego Costa would make mincemeat of him if he is up front for Chelsea.\nTo compete, Liverpool will need a solid four in the middle, with their full-backs looking to join the attack.\nWhether it be Glen Johnson on the right or Alberto Moreno on the left, when one goes forward, then the other should sit back.\nThat way, Liverpool will always have five defensive players to guard against Chelsea's counter-attacks.\nGoing forward, they need their full-backs to contribute in the same way they did last season when they overlapped down the flanks or broke forward with speed.\nThe trio of Adam Lallana, Philippe Coutinho and Raheem Sterling as attacking midfielders provide pace, trickery and creativity and, leading the line, Borini gives more energy than Lambert or Balotelli.\nHe will have to work hard down the channels to keep Chelsea's defence busy.\nEven if all of that works, however, it is still hard to see Liverpool winning on Saturday because Chelsea are on a different planet to every other Premier League team at the moment.\nJose Mourinho's side have not been at their best in the last couple of games but they have not lost any of them either.\nThe only way you would describe their form as disappointing would be in comparison to the way they started the season, when they were electric.\nThe Blues do not seem to have a weakness and, just like in April, I see them leaving Anfield with three points.\nThere is no title on the line this time, but it will still hurt the home fans.\nWhatever happens on Saturday will not make up for what was probably the worst moment of Gerrard's career. He may never make up for it, but there is no way he is finished.\nHe was Liverpool's best player against Newcastle and, despite it still being uncertain whether he will get a new Reds contract in the summer, I definitely see him as being part of their longer-term future.\nPlaying in that defensive midfield role, he can remain competitive in the Premier League. I cannot see him being allowed to leave Anfield but, if he does, he will end up at another top club.\nThe older you get, the harder you have to work, though, and extending his career will be a mental battle as well as a physical one.\nAt 34, he does not have to prove he can ping a ball 60 yards, deliver a great free-kick or make a crunching tackle.\nWhat he has to show is that he can still get about the park well enough to do all of those things effectively.\nBecause, whether he likes it or not, every time he has a bad game he will hear the accusation that \"his legs have gone\".\nOf course he is still fit and can still run. He is probably one of the fittest players at Liverpool. At 36, when I was at Derby, I was still in the top two or three players whenever we did the bleep test.\nWhat happened against Chelsea last time probably destroyed Gerrard on the inside\nBut it is the recovery that will test him. When you are flying, you can close someone down, then charge into the next challenge or situation.\nAs you get older, it is harder to get to the next man in time to make a difference. That is what people mean when they say your legs have gone.\nThere is nothing worse as a high-energy midfield player to know that, two or three years ago, you could have made that next challenge - and now you can't.\nI knew it when it happened to me. I would try not to think it but you cannot escape it and it was horrendous. I began to doubt myself and whether anybody would want me to play for them.\nWhat does not help is what other people say. Managers and players told me I was finished but I had to keep believing in myself.\nI knew I was not the player I was, but I still felt I had something to offer.\nFor me, Gerrard undoubtedly does too. Along with Sterling and Sturridge he is still one of Liverpool's most important players.\nOf all the players I faced in my career, he was the one I would have loved to have played with.\nHe was a nightmare to play against because he had everything. At his peak he was the best midfielder the Premier League has seen.\nSaturday will be a difficult occasion for him because what happened against Chelsea last time probably destroyed him on the inside.\nOf course he will be thinking about it before the game - he must think about it all the time - but he has not let it stop him.\nIt would have been easy for him to quit after a disappointment like that, but he has kept going like he always does.\nIt is that kind of desire that will keep him going beyond the end of this season too.\nRobbie Savage was speaking to BBC Sport's Chris Bevan",

        "document": "Compared with other European countries, many apprenticeships are low quality and too short, the Sutton Trust warns.\nIt says thousands of apprenticeships should be created to boost the economy and improve youngsters' job prospects.\nThe Department for Education says apprenticeships are being reformed to \"drive up standards\".\nThe Association of Colleges said some existing apprenticeships were respected by industry and should be preserved.\nThe study, which was carried out by the Boston Consulting Group on behalf of the Sutton Trust, says fewer than 200,000 of the 520,000 apprenticeships starting in England every year are rated at level three - which is equivalent to A-level.\nThe report cites figures that suggest  apprenticeships are offered by just one in five (20%) of employers in England, compared with over half (51%) in Germany, which, the report says, is considered to have one of the best vocational education systems.\nOnly 61,000 new apprenticeship starts were for young people, whereas in Germany, 570,000 new apprenticeships are for youngsters and 90% of these are equivalent to A-levels.\nThe report also notes that England's vocational system has 18,000 different qualifications, while Germany has 330.\nThe report warns that since 2010, more than half (58%) of apprenticeships have been below level three and three-quarters have been aimed at those over the age of 25, many of whom are already in work.\nAnd it warns 11 young people are competing for each apprenticeship.\nIn his foreword to the report, Sutton Trust chairman Sir Peter Lampl said the report had found that, with some exceptions, the opportunities on offer to young people who did not go to university were \"poor\".\nThe attitude in England, with some exceptions, was very different to that in countries such as Germany and Switzerland, he said.\n\"Instead of a clear system of respected vocational routes, we suffer from a complicated patchwork where too many young people are offered qualifications of little worth in a system that confuses employers and is not valued as it should be by society,\" he said.\nHe said the \"cruel deception\" about an expansion in apprenticeships, when many were below level three and the majority went to older workers, had to stop.\nThe report calls for apprenticeships to be radically expanded, with up to 300,000 new starts each year. The majority of these should be at level three at least for three years, with some four-year courses at level four - higher than A-levels.\nNo more than 10% of apprenticeships should be two-year courses at level two, it says.\nSir Peter said: \"Real apprenticeships are as important to social mobility as good university degrees.\n\"Students facing huge loans for a university education find themselves between a rock and a hard place. Even if they would prefer to work with training, the lack of good apprenticeships means they feel they have little choice.\n\"England's patchwork vocational system not only hinders our economic competitiveness, it prevents tens of thousands of young people from gaining good skilled jobs.\"\nTeresa Frith, from the Association of Colleges, said: \"Creating 300,000 apprenticeships, when the report acknowledges there is already a shortage of apprenticeship places for 16 to-year-olds, would be a massive challenge and although we agree that there is a business case for employers to take on apprentices, at the moment too few do.\n\"The report also says level three apprenticeships should be the priority. This isn't a bad idea in principle but some level two apprenticeships, such as those in construction, are well-respected by the industry and should be preserved.\n\"The report is absolutely right to say that vocational courses should only be taught in institutions with high-quality facilities and expert teaching staff and that careers advice and guidance needs to be improved.\"\nA Department for Education spokeswoman said: \"We are already radically reforming apprenticeships to drive up standards so that they are more rigorous and responsive to the needs of employers.\n\"Since 2010 over a million people have become apprentices, providing a great start to their careers. We have already insisted that apprenticeships last for a minimum of a year, include more English and maths and that every apprenticeship is a job.\n\"We have consulted on wider reforms to drive up standards in apprenticeships further, and will publish plans later this month.\"",

the larger nuclear powered ones and smaller diesel electric submarines which can operate in shallow waters.\nEarlier this month Russia launched what it claims is the \"quietest submarine in the world\".\nPeter Roberts, a former Royal Navy officer, and now a senior fellow at the defence think tank RUSI, says it now leads the world in submarine development.\nHe describes them as technologically advanced and their crews as highly skilled.\nThey are, he says, the \"quietest and most challenging adversary in the world\".\nWhen out on patrol they can go undetected for months at a time.\nOften the first time a Nato warship will be aware of their presence is when a periscope briefly pops above the waves.\nThey lie silent and stationary at the bottom of the ocean listening to and \"fingerprinting\" other nations' submarines and warships.\nFor this exercise, curiously named \"Dynamic Mongoose\", as well as the warships there are anti-submarine warfare helicopters helping in the search.\nFor the first time, a Nato research vessel has also deployed underwater unmanned vehicles or drones to help track the ocean.\nScientists on board listen to the familiar pings as the two robots shaped like torpedoes scan the seabed.\nIt is not always easy to distinguish between the shipwrecks, whales, fish shoals and rocky outcrops in the sea.\nRyan Goldhahn, scientist-in-charge at Nato's Centre for Maritime Research and Experimentation, says the underwater robots, which appear on their monitors as Harpo and Groucho, have several advantages to the warships and aircraft involved in the exercise.\nThey are cheaper to operate, take the person out of harm's way and can offer persistent surveillance.\nUnderwater drones are for the future.\nBut for now one of the most important assets in any nation's armoury to conduct anti-submarine warfare is the long-range maritime patrol aircraft.\nThese are able to fly long distances while scanning hundreds of miles beneath the ocean.\nFor this exercise, the top cover is being provided by a French Atlantique maritime patrol aircraft.\nInside in a darkened cabin, half a dozen crew stare at the monitors that can help pinpoint submarines below.\nBritain no longer has any of its own maritime patrol aircraft and this exercise is a reminder of a significant gap in the UK's defences.\nSeveral times over the past year Britain has had to call on its Nato allies to provide eyes in the sky when there have been reported Russian submarines in or near Britain's waters.\nRUSI's Mr Roberts says it is a \"key vulnerability\".\nHe says the lack of any maritime patrol aircraft, that used to be provided by the Nimrod, means a Russian submarine could sit off the UK and track the nuclear deterrent as it leaves Faslane naval base in Scotland.\nBritain, he says, should be \"exceptionally worried\" that it is seen as a \"soft touch\", because Russia will continue to test its defences, just as they have by flying long range bombers near UK airspace.\nThe purpose of this exercise is to ensure Nato is ready to conduct anti-submarine warfare.\nBut it is also a reminder that some nations - including Britain - cannot do it alone.\nThe lack of any UK maritime patrol aircraft will have to be addressed in the government's forthcoming defence and security review.\nThe search for Russian submarines will not be as easy as the hunt for U33.",

I'm rather perplexed by this debate, which has been going in the UK for some time, because I view taxes as not optional.\n\"I view that you should pay the taxes that are legally required. It's not a debate. You pay the taxes.\n\"If the British system changes the tax laws, then we will comply. If the taxes go up, we will pay more, if they go down, we will pay less.

        "document": "It says something for the way the team have fallen from past greatness that the result they are talking about is the fourth row of the grid - or the third if things go especially well - and some decent points.\nThis, from a team that has won 182 grands prix, at a win rate of 23.18%, 12 drivers' world championships, and eight constructors' titles. And which still, despite its dire current results, has two world champions in the cockpit - one of them, Fernando Alonso, arguably the best on the grid.\nListen: Dennis on Alonso, loyalty & mentality\nThe slump started in 2013, when McLaren lost its way on chassis design, but still had the best engine.\nNow, the team seem to have got their mojo back with the car but the problems lie with the Honda power-unit.\nThis is a far cry from the previous era of one of the most famous partnerships in F1 - it is with Honda that McLaren achieved their greatest successes of an illustrious history.\nIn 1988, they swept a season like no-one has since, even Mercedes. With the two best drivers in the world in their cars, Ayrton Senna and Alain Prost, they won 15 of the 16 races.\nThey dominated the next four years, before spending several years in the doldrums - a dip at times as bad as the latest one - before more resounding success, with Mika Hakkinen and Mercedes engines in 1998-99.\nAmazingly, the team's last constructors' title was in the first of those two years of victories with the 'flying Finn'.\nThey should have won it again, in 2007, when Alonso and Lewis Hamilton were team-mates and finished agonisingly tied in the championship, a single point behind the winner, Kimi Raikkonen of Ferrari.\nBut although the team scored more points than any other, McLaren were kicked out of the constructors' championship that year - and fined $100m - after being found guilty of benefitting from their illegal possession of reams of Ferrari technical information.\nThere was another scandal two years later - this time dubbed 'lie-gate' - after Hamilton and  sporting director Dave Ryan were found to have misled the stewards at the Australian Grand Prix. This led to a humiliating public apology from Hamilton, and the sack for Ryan.\nUntil 2012, when Hamilton and team-mate Jenson Button won seven races between them, the victories kept coming, but other than Hamilton's in 2008, the titles dried up - and now the wins have, too.\nIn many ways, their current predicament is nothing surprising. McLaren's F1 history has, like those of many long-term participants, been a cycle of triumph and decline.\nTheir first decade, following the team's establishment by the New Zealand F1 driver Bruce McLaren was spent building up the team into an increasingly powerful force, a process that continued despite the founder's death in a testing crash in 1970.\nTheir maiden title came in 1974, with the Brazilian Emerson Fittipaldi. Another followed two years later, courtesy of James Hunt in his now-famous battle with Ferrari's Niki Lauda.\nBut then the team began to slip backwards, left behind by the technology of the time. Rather like now.\nSo alarming was the dip in form that main sponsor Marlboro engineered a coup, bringing on board Ron Dennis, first as co-team boss. He took complete control shortly afterwards and has held it ever since, in one role or another.\nDennis built the team up to its first period of real domination in 1984-5, followed by the Honda era, then a partnership with Mercedes, before stepping back in 2009, only to take back control after the team's disastrous 2013 season.\nSo far, his return has not had its intended effect. But is McLaren in a period of slow - some would even say terminal - decline? Or are the good times around the corner again?\nDennis insists it is only a matter of time before success will return.\nIt is McLaren, he told BBC Sport in an interview to mark the team's golden anniversary, who will break Mercedes' hegemony in F1, and become the next team after the German giants to win the title.\nThis, after all, is why Alonso returned to the team in 2015 - a decision widely questioned at the time because of the difficult relationship he had with Dennis when they worked together in 2007.\nThe Spanish two-time champion left Ferrari because he felt they would never get there; joined McLaren partly because there was nowhere else to go, but also because he felt the renewed Honda partnership was his best chance to win an elusive third title in the end.\nDennis and his lieutenants believe they are in the process of arresting the slide, that the car is among the very best this year, and that next year Honda - who last year re-entered F1 too soon - will ensure their engine is, too.\nThey can see the progress, they say, and it is only a matter of time before they again deliver \"championships, plural\", as Dennis puts it.\nBut right now, belief is all they have. And on it rests not only a successful end to the career of one of the sport's greatest ever drivers, but also the reputation of one of its greatest names.\nSubscribe to the BBC Sport newsletter to get our pick of news, features and video sent to your inbox.",

There were no immediate reports of injuries or damage.\nItaly is prone to earthquakes. In 2009 almost 300 people died in a quake in L'Aquila in the central Abruzzo region.\nItaly's National Institute of Geophysics and Volcanology (INGV) said the quake struck at 15:48 (14:48 GMT), with its epicentre in Garfagnana.\nSeveral aftershocks of lower magnitude were felt across a large area.\nPhone lines were down and power supplies were cut in the Garfagnana area, Italian news agency Ansa reports. As a precaution, schools were said to have been evacuated in the immediate vicinity and were to be checked for any damage.\nIn Milan, top floors of tall office blocks shook and the quake was also felt in the cities of Bologna and Modena.\nIn Lucca, people poured out into the streets, Ansa said.\nLast May, two earthquakes in the same area left more than 20 people dead. The strongest tremor was magnitude-6 and caused significant damage.\nAlessandro Amato of the INGV said the latest tremor \"came out of nowhere\", and described it as a classic earthquake for the area - \"medium-strong\" and \"fairly shallow\".\nItaly is still trying to recover from the aftermath of the deadly earthquake in L'Aquila.\nSix scientists and an ex-official were convicted of multiple manslaughter in October 2012 for giving a falsely reassuring statement.\nThe group, all members of the National Commission for the Forecast and Prevention of Serious Risks, were accused of having provided \"inaccurate, incomplete and contradictory\" information about the danger of the tremors felt ahead of the 6 April 2009 quake.\nAt a meeting a few days before the deadly quake, they had told officials in L'Aquila that, while a major earthquake was not impossible, it was not likely.\nOn the night of the quake, many people are said to have remained in their homes and died because of the advice, while others who had decided to remain outside in the street survived.",

        "document": "It comes in a shake-up of UK military buildings and resettling of regiments.\nBrecon and Radnorshire Conservative MP Chris Davies condemned the closure, saying there had been a barracks in Brecon since 1805, home to troops who fought the Zulus at Rorke's Drift.\n\"This decision is abhorrent and I shall be fighting it every step of the way,\" he said.\n\"The government has a great deal of questions to answer over why it is proposing to close a well-loved and historic barracks in a vitally important military town.\n\"Brecon Barracks has served our country with distinction over its long history, with soldiers from the site fighting in every conflict since the early 19th century.\n\"This decision shows a blatant lack of respect for that history.\"\nMr Davies said he was launching a petition against the decision, saying the Brecon area had some of the highest unemployment levels in Wales.\nHe also hoped the closure would not damage the town's \"thriving\" military tourism industry.\nBrecon barracks has about 85 civilian staff and 90 military but it is not thought jobs are at risk.\nMr Davies said he understood the nearby Sennybridge training ground and infantry school at Dering Lines would not be affected.\nDefence Secretary Sir Michael Fallon told the Commons on Monday the reorganisation in Wales would see a specialist light infantry centre created at St Athan, Vale of Glamorgan.\nCawdor Barracks, Pembrokeshire - whose closure was previously announced in 2013 - will now shut in 2024, while a storage depot at Sennybridge will go in 2025.\nResponding for Labour, Shadow Defence Secretary Nia Griffith, MP for Llanelli, said the ministry was \"right to restructure its estate\".\nBut she warned closing bases would affect the livelihoods of many people who would face \"gnawing uncertainty\" over their future.",
